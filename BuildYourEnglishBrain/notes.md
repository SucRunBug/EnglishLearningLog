## P1 Course Introduction

强调使用英文的思考方式来学习英文。

## P2 Tips

### work hard

想要进步必须要努力练习。

### Be an English Thinker

不要使用自己母语的语言思维来学习英文。

### Correct Way + Spend time = Success

花时间不一定成功，但花时间和使用正确的方式可以成功。

### Play, Jump and Swim

就像玩一样去学习英语，用英语来进行创造性的思考，而不是把英语当成数学来学习。creatively

要尽力去尝试表达，而不是有所保留。no reservations

让自己沉浸于英语环境中。immerse

总结下来就是三个词：play, jump, swim

### 30 minutes

想要学习英语，必须要周期性地去做，比如一天至少半小时要用来学习英语。

### feedback

要有反馈。（我想通过输出来检测自己，自己给自己反馈，比如用GPT检测）

find forum 论坛

### lifestyle

让英文成为生活方式，如果可以，享受英语。（比如我现在就尝试把游戏设置为全英文的）

## P3 Reading

### Why reading is important

阅读作为所有英语学习的基础，就像一棵树中的树干

教学示例：

While red wine is produced in many different regions around the world, each of these regions share common features. 

### Why should one read more?

比如produced什么时候才能用，能不能用于女人生孩子？知道了葡萄酒是可以用produce，读得越多，就越知道哪些词使用在哪些情况更加恰当。

### What to do when encountering new words 

假设你不知道region的意思，根据前面的in和后面的around world，可以猜出region是全世界都有的地方，比如areas, places，猜测结束后可以去look up or check it in the dictionary(only English Dictionary)

推荐网站：[Vocabulary.com - Learn Words - English Dictionary](https://www.vocabulary.com/)

这个网站很不错，我之前还到处找，都没这个界面漂亮。

总之猜词就是要多根据上下文，这还可以强制我们使用英语思维？？？

假设你不知道common features，通过While, different来猜出是same characteristics or things

### Recommendations for Reading Resources 

阅读网站推荐(需要科学上网)：

www.reddit.com

www.wikipedia.com

阅读书籍推荐：

- fiction:

*Harry Potter*

- non-fiction:

Biography/Who is ...

Such as *Who was Steve Jobs*



## P4 New Words

### how to learn a new word

Using English Dictionary

learn forms, finding and learning a word with its all forms, such as learn/learning/learned

learn a word in context

Example: There seemed to be a direct correlation between the number of babies born and the health standards in that area. 

If we don't know "correlation" in the sentense, look up it and find out it is a n., and we find that its verb form is "correlate", and we find out it has adjective form "correlated"

correlated-correlate-correlation

And we can find out the definition of this word is "a connection" or "a relationship"

再从上下文中the number of babies born and the health standards推断意思，把同义词放进去看是否通顺

再造几个新句子来使用新学会的词：

I wonder if there is a correlation between happiness and income.

Global warming and natural disasters are obviously correlated.

造完句后还需要检查是否正确

这就是学习一个单词的全过程：通过上下文推测、查英文字典查看释义、将同义词放入原文看是否通顺、了解所有形式、用新学的词造几个类似的句子、检测句子是否正确。

"But the struggle, the difficulty is what makes it stick in your mind."

## P5 Idioms

### Explain

An idiom is a special phrase

根据文化有所不同

### Example

常见的一个Idioms: over the top

意思是too much

比如join interview面试，穿的tuxedo燕尾服，可以说that suit is over the top

Idioms 是不能随便用的，要特定人群、特定场合下说出一种绕弯子、话里有话的感觉。

再学一个：one in a million

这个one就是unique, special, rare, precious

使用于描述人时会更好，代表自己的主观感受。

My wife is one in a million.

My wife is unique. 这里的unique可能有多个含义：strange, unusual，它的内涵connotations有很多，所以使用起来比较危险。

但当描述口音时使用Your accent is unique.会好一些，可能表示口音interesting or silly

## P6 4-Word Exercise

帮助英语思维的练习：首先写下四个单词

Stable, Stick, Common, across

建议包含nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs

名词、形容词、动词、副词

然后将这四个词放入一个句子中，当然，这四个词可以是不同的forms

示例：As a common rule, I'd say sticking to your plans will make you come across as a stable person to others.

I thought I'd come across just a common stick, but if was actually part of a fence used in prehistoric stables.

我的练习：I used some sticks to stablize my common house across the big river.

这句话存在以下语法错误： 1. “stablize”拼写错误，应为“stabilize”； 2. “common house”表述不太准确，可以改为“ordinary house”或“simple house”等更恰当的表达； 3. “across the big river”前缺少谓语动词，可改为“located across the big river”。 修改后的句子：I used some sticks to stabilize my ordinary house located across the big river.

I signed up a accountant in a stange website, and find a video which recording a ship beneath the water. 

## P7 Variations

**改写练习原句**：I think it might take a few days for me to help you book your tickets.

**My practice**: I guess it would take some days for me to purchase tickets for you.

**Techear's examples**:

I think I can have your tikets booked in a few days.

Give me a few days to book your tickets.

I can reserve your tickets if you like, but it might take a few days.

If you give me a few days, I can book your tickets.

这几个句子的connotation内涵都有些区别，比如内涵自己是否真的答应别人订票，以及是否礼貌，但我觉得没有必要追求特别多的逻辑，多读几遍感受就行。

总之，练习的方式就是找一个喜欢的句子，看自己能改写成多少不同的句子，并维持意思大致相同。

## P8 Full Variations

**改写练习原句：**

Adele had been living on the West coast, in California, for about six years,so when she finally decided to come home, there was a huge reception.It seemed strange to her that, even though so much time had passed, nothing much had changed. The old house looked the same,and so did her family. She spent a week catching up visiting relatives before going back to California.She told herself she wouldn't let another six years passbefore seeing them again.

events, what happened

**我的练习：**

Adele had been living on the West coast, in California, for about six years. And she finally decided to back her own home to catch up with relatives. While she got there, she meet a bunch of familar people in her home. And she found nothing changed in these years. Before she back to California, she told her relatives that she would back regularly.

**Here’s a refined version of your text with improved grammar:**

"Adele had been living on the West Coast, in California, for about six years. She finally decided to return to her hometown to catch up with relatives. When she arrived, she met a bunch of familiar people at her home and found that nothing had changed over the years. Before going back to California, she told her relatives that she would visit regularly."

**Changes made:**
1. Changed "decided to back her own home" to "decided to return to her hometown."
2. Replaced "While she got there" with "When she arrived."
3. Corrected "meet" to "met" for past tense consistency.
4. Corrected "familar" to "familiar."
5. Reworded "Before she back to California" to "Before going back to California."
6. Used "visit" instead of "back" for clarity in the final sentence.


**Teacher's example:**

Six years had passed in California since Adele had last seen her family, and at last she decided to go home for a visit.  She was totally shocked when she got there.  Her whole family had a gathering to welcome her.  Surprisingly, everything seemed unchanged.  After a week seeing extended family, she headed back to the West coast and made a mental note that she would soon go back for a visit.

## P9 Listening

用一个30秒到最多1分钟的英文音频片段来练习听力，这个片段难度很大，一开始听只能听懂20-30%，通过反复听，最后要能听懂80%以上。练习时有个笔记本来记录听到的内容。

## P10 Listening Practice

The dire American education system has spawned a wide range of proposals and half baked solutions. The core of the problem according to most is a test oriented system which has become increasingly narrow and stringent in recent years. The difficulty is finding an applicable alternative, any viable model of teaching and evaluating students would have to be both inclusive and comprehensive. Well, at the same time recognizing individual achievement. Whatever the case, most officials and leaders have concluded that the current problem doesn't lie in the hands of the teachers, but rather than the standards handed down by the education board.

因为太快了，只能一句一句反复听，然后写下来，然后用了飞书妙记给识别出来校对，校对后查不会的词，然后再反复多听几遍。我也不清楚这样有没有用。

## P11 Thinking Exercises

Force you thinking in english, such as describ what you see out the window, what you feel and what might happen next. And make it to your habit.

## P12 Writing

建议每天都要有10分钟来练习写作

### Things to Remember

- Punctuation is key. '.' is period and ',' is common
- syntax (grammar) try to change different syntax (write a new version after finish one)
- specific adjectives (e.g. good at speaking - articulate) do not use simple word
- explore vocab(use the new words that you learn correctly)
- check it(make revisions)

### Writing Prompts
- What's your plan for the week?
- Describe something unusual that happened yesterday.
- Describe a movie you watched recently.
- Diary

## P13 Movies

### Passive way

watching movie or TV show with subtitles of your own language.

But it is really slow to make progress.

### Recommend

Anime: Pixar's movies, like Finding Nemo, Cars and Monsters' Inc.

TV show: Friends

movie: Harry Potter

documentary: Planet Earth

### Active way

choose a movie you know well, watch that movie without subtitles, and take notes like what you hear or a new word you learn.
