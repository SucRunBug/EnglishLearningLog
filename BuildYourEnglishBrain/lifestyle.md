### Media evaluation 

The Good

- Sun Wukong's magical abilities are wonderfully adapted to the game's combat 
- An unusual combo system ensures that its fast-paced combat doesn't quite feel like anything else 
- Boss battles are frequently stunning and force you to make full use of your repertoire 
- Environments are gorgeous and varied 

The Bad 

- The story assumes you have knowledge of Journey to the West and is tough to follow without it 
- The level design is simple and dull, and enemies are too scarce 

### Netizen comments 

Indeed, The journey to the East for us westerners. 这一次，换我们西方人去东方取经了。

We're getting a game that's based on a book series from the 16th century and lets you play as a badass monkey that can shapeshift and ride clouds? Sign me the fuck up 我买爆

### Introduction to the background of Journey to the West

#### About the book

Key words: Journey to the West & Four Great Classical Novels(水浒传 Outlaws of the Marsh; 三国演义 Romance of the Three Kingdoms; 红楼梦 Dream of the Road Chamber)

- Journey to the West is one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, written in the 16th century by 吴承恩(Wu Chengen). 
- The novel is a mix of myth, folklore, and religious elements, and it has had a profound impact on Chinese culture and literature.

#### Main Plot & Main Characters

The story follows the journey of the monk 玄奘法师(Master Xuanzang)(aka. 唐三藏 Tang Sanzang) from the Tang Dynasty who was tasked with traveling to India to retrieve sacred Buddhist scriptures. 

玄奘法师(Master Xuanzang) is accompanied by four disciples: 

- 孙悟空(Sun Wukong=The Monkey King):Apowerful and mischievous monkey with incredible strength, agility, and the ability to transform into various beings. He was initally a rebel but was subdued by Buddha and later assigned to protect Xuanzang. 
- 猪八戒(Zhu Bajie= Pigsy):A pig-like creature with a gluttonous and lazy nature,who serves as a comic relief but is also a loyal companion. 
- 沙悟净(Sha Wujing=Sandy):A calm and loyal figure,depicted as a sand ogre. 
- 白龙马(BaiLoong Ma=White-Dragon Horse):Originally dragon prince(Loong=Chinese dragon),he was transformed into a white horse as a punishment and serves as Xuanzang's steed. 

#### 81 Tribulations

- It was said that Master Xuanzang' s team had to go through 81 challenges during their journey before they could successfully reach the Buddha. 
- These tribulations were tests of their resolve, faith, and character, designed to purify them and help them achieve spiritual enlightenment. 
- Most of the tribulations feature encounters with demons, monsters, and other supernatural beings, some of them will reappear in the game and have somewhat become stronger!

#### Connection between the novel and the game

- The Main Character of the game "the Destined One"is likely Wukong himself, or one of his monkey minions. 
- It seems that the story in the game takes place after the events of *Journey to the West*. Based on the avaiable contents (without giving any spoilers), it can be inferred that a great upheaval occurred in the world, leading to the resurrection of many yaoguai/demons, some of whom have even become stronger. (Maybe just like in Dark Souls, the flames are dying! or like in Elden Ring, the Ring has been shattered, transforming the Lands Between into a chaotic place.)

#### More about Wukong 

- Born from a stone: Yes, Wukong was formerly a magical stone (so supposedly he is asexual? talking about "inclusiveness" Lmao). His skin is often described as "hard as a stone"in the story. 
- The Havoc in Heaven: ln his early days, Wukong proclaimed himself a title "齐天大圣(Qi Tian Da Sheng = The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal)" and rebelled against the Heavenly order. 
  - He single-handedly battled with the 100,000 Heavenly Soldiers and defeated many famous celestial generals, ineluding "四大天王 the 4 Heavenly Kings" (who also appeared in the game trailer). He also had an epic battle with 二郎神-杨戬( Erlang God Yang Jian -the God of War with three eyes) and eventually lost. 
- Weapons: Wukong's weapon is called 如意金箍棒 (Ru Yi Jin Gu Bang = the Golden Staff) 
- Trick - 72 Transformations: Wukong is able to shapeshift into more than 72 different creatures (72 is for exaggeration). I think in the game you can also shapeshift into other animals to solve puzzles?

The corrected sentence should be:

DEI = Diversity, Equity, Inclusion 多样性、公平性、包容性

The title of a article called "How Black Myth: Wukong Developer's History of Sexism Is Complicating its Journey to the West" showing bais from DEI.

The title "How Black Myth: Wukong Developer's History of Sexism Is Complicating its Journey to the West" could be interpreted as showing bias from a DEI.

Rumor - Black Myth: Wukong devs reject $7 million 'extortion' from DEI consultants. Details below.

The game "Black Myth: Wukong" was labeled "Lacking Diversity", "Sexism", "Anti-DEI" and "Lacking Inclusivity" by DEI.
