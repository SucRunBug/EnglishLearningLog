The Good

- Sun Wukong's magical abilities are wonderfully adapted to the game's combat 
- An unusual combo system ensures that its fast-paced combat doesn't quite feel like anything else 
- Boss battles are frequently stunning and force you to make full use of your repertoire 
- Environments are gorgeous and varied 

The Bad 

- The story assumes you have knowledge of Journey to the West and is tough to follow without it 
- The level design is simple and dull, and enemies are too scarce

Indeed, The journey to the East for us westerners. 这一次，换我们西方人去东方取经了。

We're getting a game that's based on a book series from the 16th century and lets you play as a badass monkey that can shapeshift and ride clouds? Sign me the fuck up 我买爆

西游记背景介绍 Introduction to the background of Journey to the West

- Journey to the West is one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, written in the 16th century by 吴承恩(Wu Chengen). 
- The novel is a mix of myth, folklore, and religious elements, and it has had a profound impact on Chinese culture and literature.
- The story follows the journey of the monk 玄奘法师(Master Xuanzang)(aka. 唐三藏 Tang Sanzang) from the Tang Dynasty who was tasked with traveling to India to retrieve sacred Buddhist scriptures. 
- 81 Tribulations: It was said that Master Xuanzang' s team had to go through 81 challenges during their journey before they could successfully reach the Buddha. These tribulations were tests of their resolve, faith, and character, designed to purify them and help them achieve spiritual enlightenment.
